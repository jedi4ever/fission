# Fission

## Intro
Fission is a simple command line tool for managing VMware Fusion VMs.  Only Fusion 3.x is currently supported.


## Install
    gem install fission


## Usage
### Clone
    fission clone existing_vm new_vm [--start]

If you provide '--start', then the new VM will be powered on after cloning


### Snapshot Create
    fission snapshot create my_vm snapshot_name

Creates a snapshot for the VM

In order to create the snapshot:

* The VM must be running
* The snapshot name must be unique


### Snapshot List
    fission snapshot list my_vm

Lists the snapshots for the VM


### Snapshot Revert
    fission snapshot revert my_vm existing_snapshot

Reverts a VM to an existing snapshot

In order to revert to the snapshot:

* The Fusion GUI cannot be running


### Start
    fission start my_vm [--headless]

Starts the VM

Providng '--headless' will start the VM without a Fusion GUI console

Note that the Fusion GUI cannot be running to start a VM with '--headless'


### Status
    fission status

Displays the status (running or not) of all of the VMs found


### Stop
    fission stop my_vm

Stops the VM


### Suspend
    fission suspend [my_vm | --all]

Suspends the VM or all running VMs


### Delete
    fission delete my_vm [--force]

Deletes the VM.  This will delete the files from disk and remove the related metadata in Fusion.

By default, the VM will not be deleted if:

* The VM is running
* The Fusion GUI is running (as the metadata cannot be cleanly removed)

Providing '--force' will:

* Stop the VM if it's running
* Delete the VM even if the Fusion GUI is running


### Help
    fission -h

or just

    fission


## Config
By default, fission will use the default VMware Fusion VM directory
(~/Documents/Virtual Machines.localized/) when cloning.  If you want to use a
different directory, you can set this in a config file.

The config file needs to be in yaml format and live at '~/.fissionrc'

    $cat ~/.fissionrc
    ---
    vm_dir: "/vm"


## Other Notable Info
The name of the VM used in the previous examples should be the directory name 
of the VM minus the '.vmwarevm' extension.  Typically the VM name and the 
directory name are the same.

As of now, VMware Fusion doesn't provide an easy, out of
the box, way to modify the personality (hostname, ip, etc.) of a VM.  Because of
this, a clone created by fission is an _exact_ copy of the original (including
hostname, ip address, etc.).  Most likely, this isn't what you want.

One approach is to create a VM which will act as a template.  Create the VM with
the desired install method (ideally with easy install) and settings, but do not
power on the VM.  You can then create clones from this VM 'template'.  When you 
power on the clone, it will start the OS install process (and assign a new ip, etc.).

## Fission with RVM
Please see the following gist for a walkthrough of making fission available 
regardless of ruby environment when using RVM https://gist.github.com/1203167
